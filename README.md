## Dress Visualization and Tailoring Platform

This repository contains the code for a dress visualization and tailoring platform. The platform allows users to personalize their dresses based on their interests and visualize them on a 3D mannequin, which is rendered based on their body type and measurements. Users can choose the cloth material of their choice and dress design of their choice from the options offered, and they are also given recommendations on the dress design and material based on their body type. The user can contact the tailor to further evaluate choices, and once the user is happy with the design, the platform offers to stitch the dress and deliver it to them.
